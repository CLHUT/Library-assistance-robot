# Library automation robot
Robots are engaged in various activities in our day to day life.
Our project aims the need of a librarian for collecting books from the library counter arraging them in a proper order.
Our robot helps the users to identify the positions of various books in the library.
The project mainly focuses on a line follower robot that  follows a black line drwan over a white surface.
The robot uses IR sensors to dectect the postion and it moves accordingly.
At present the world is moving with industrial automation and many improvements in the field of robotics but we are lagging in the case of library.
Despite from the vast availabilty of ebooks such as kindle etc people is still favour in reading books.
In large libraries people invest more time to serach books.so our project is valid here.
